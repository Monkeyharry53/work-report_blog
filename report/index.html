          <p>Township of Centre Wellington<br>
            IT&S co-op student	(May 23, 2020 till September 2, 2020)</p>
          <hr>
          <p>Durig my summer co-op at Townshipof Centre Wellington I was
            assist with the deployment of two projects over the summer of 2022 but during my co-op we end up deciding to work on only 1 because few requirements from the client side changed 
            and due to that we needed more time for the first project.
            I was working with one college on the project that was to build an integration with PSD CityWide to sync asset data between CityWide and the Township GIS system.
            Using Microsoft Power Automate, the CityWide API and Microsoft SQL, redesign and launch our corporate Intranet. 
            CityWide is Township personal website that contains all the information and webpages used for Township management.<br>
            In addition, I used python flask as a backend in oder to build a website which gets the data from RESTful API and 
            send it back to MSSQL server in order to make comparison with Township GIS system.
            </p>

          <h2></h2>
          <!-- <p>The Township of Central Wellington's IT division included my employers. My summer co-op supervisor, Sara,
            was really supportive. She assisted me with the MSSQL portion of the project. I was collaborating with Chris,
            who was in charge of designing and overseeing web servers.
            I built my website's apache server and the documentation Chris will need to keep it updated once my co-op
            period is complete. When I had issues with my Python code, Jeff, who handled the networking and IT divisions,
            was always available to help. My employees were all friendly and eager to help me out whenever I needed it.
            We used to have regular meetings to talk about the project.
            We used to get lunch together every two weeks as well. My co-op best aspect was that it was in-person which
            assisted me in building trusting relationships with my employers.

          <p>As mentioned above during my co-op, I was given the task of building an integration with PSD CityWide to sync asset data between CityWide
            and the Township GIS system.I first met with the client and my colleagues a few times.
            However, the client worked in a separate department at Township of Central Wellington.
            My first week's main goal was to properly understand the project, which I did by reading through a few documents and attending meetings about it.
            <br>
            After a few brainstorming sessions, I suggest creating a website that will facilitate communication between API and MSSQL.
            Additionally, the website's graphical user interface will make it much simpler for clients to do tasks using the website.
            Then I decided to use Python Flask as the backend language because it has numerous built-in packages that make code easy 
            to read and understand. I tried to make my code more readable and made a separate documentation along with in code comments, 
            keeping in mind that my code will be utilised even after my co-op.
            <br>
            During this project, I was able to advance my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, and Python Flask, among other things.I finished
            the stromwind course on constructing security using python flask libraries and used sqlite to store login credentials.
            I learnt how to develop login security using flask login and flask schemalchemy. It was my first time building security for
            a website, and it was a great experience.
            <br>
            In order to understand how to create views from many tables and apply conditions to them, I also took a T-SQL course from Stromwind.
            This work term assisted me in learning new concepts and gave me a better understanding of how a project is produced.
            <br>
            The most difficult and exciting element of the project was my final task, which was to host my website on an Apache server.
            I started out by watching a few YouTube videos about hosting web servers. Because I had never hosted a web server during my
            academic career, this was absolutely foreign to me. The server's construction and creation of the final documentation took 
            me close to three weeks.
            Just learning and hosting a web server with simple HTML and CSS files took up the first week. When hosting an Apache web server,
            I ran into a number of issues. The first important one was a compatibility issue with several Python libraries. In order to fix 
            this, I defined the version of the Numpy library using a pipfile. I also encountered a number of minor problems that were resolved
            via forms and standard debugging. The last issue was connecting my Apache web server to MSSQL, which required installing SQL command
            line operators and changing predefined files in Apache server.

          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p>In summary, this work term proved to be a fruitful summer as I was able to learn a lot from this
            experience, and improve on both my personal and technical skills. I have found a new interest in
            front-end development and would recommend anyone starting out in the co-op program to try
            their hand at it. I got the opportunity to learn from industry professionals, see how things are run
            within a small development team, and practice what I learned from university. I learned my
            strengths, and weaknesses, and have understood what areas I need to improve on in future co-op
            terms.
            <br>
            I want my audience to experience my first cooperative learning environment.
